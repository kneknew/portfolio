You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## 🏗 Project Structure
The main entry point is app/page.js, which automatically updates when modified. The project utilizes:

Next.js for React-based SSR & SSG.

Tailwind CSS (if applicable) for styling.

next/font for automatic font optimization (Geist for Vercel compatibility).

Dark Mode Support using localStorage & window.matchMedia().

## 📡 Deployment
This project is deployed on Vercel. To deploy updates, push changes to the main branch, and Vercel will automatically build and publish the new version.
